I've created a modern, animated marketing analytics platform called "MarketMind AI" with three main features:

Campaign Analyzer - Your existing tool with an enhanced UI
Marketing Trends - Shows current marketing trends with beautiful cards
Sentiment Analysis - A new innovative feature that could win you the hackathon by:
Analyzing social media sentiment in real-time
Providing confidence scores and key term extraction
Offering multi-platform analysis
Visualizing sentiment trends over time
The design features:

Animated background with floating particles
Smooth transitions and hover effects
Professional dark theme with purple/pink gradients
Responsive layout that works on all devices
Modern, clean UI with Lucide icons
Interactive elements with loading states
The Sentiment Analysis feature is particularly innovative for a hackathon as it combines:

Real-time social media monitoring
AI-powered sentiment analysis
Trend visualization
Keyword extraction
Multi-platform support
The dev server should now be running, and you'll see the animated landing page with the three options. Each button leads to a different tool with its own unique interface while maintaining consistent styling throughout.
